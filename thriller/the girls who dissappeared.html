	<p style="font-size:20px">PRE-ORDER CLAIRE DOUGLAS', BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF THE COUPLE AT NO 9, NEW GRIPPING NOVEL NOW
        Three missing girls. A twenty year mystery. A woman on the verge of discovering the truth . . .
        In a rural Wilshire town lies The Devil's Corridor. A road which has witnessed eerie happenings from unexplained deaths to the sounds of a child crying at night.
        But nothing more puzzling than the Olivia Rutherford case. Four girls drove home but after their car crashed only Olivia was found.
        Twenty years later, journalist Jenna Halliday is covering the case. But the locals aren't happy with this stranger's arrival. Least of all Olivia.
        Jenna soon starts receiving threatening notes and it is clear someone wants her out of this town before she suffers a dark fate . . .
