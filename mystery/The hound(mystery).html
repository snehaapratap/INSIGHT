	<h2>Author : Arthur Conan Doyle</h2>
	<p style="font-size:20px">"The Hound of the Baskervilles" is a detective novel written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, first published in 1902. It features one of Doyle's most famous characters, Sherlock Holmes, along with his loyal friend and narrator, Dr. John Watson. The story is set in the moorlands of Devonshire, England, and revolves around the legend of a supernatural hound that haunts the Baskerville family. Holmes and Watson are tasked with investigating the death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose demise is believed to be connected to the curse of the hound. The novel is a blend of mystery, suspense, and Gothic elements, and it showcases Holmes' deductive reasoning and analytical skills as he works to unravel the truth behind the legend.
