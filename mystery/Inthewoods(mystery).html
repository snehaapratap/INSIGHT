	<h2>Author : Tana French</h2>
	<p style="font-size:20px">"In the Woods" is a psychological thriller novel written by Tana French. Published in 2007, it is the first book in the Dublin Murder Squad series. The story follows Detective Rob Ryan as he investigates the murder of a young girl in a small Irish town. What makes this case particularly challenging for him is that he has a personal connection to the same woods where the murder occurred â€“ he himself survived a traumatic event there as a child. As the investigation unfolds, Rob's past and the current case become intertwined, raising questions about memory, identity, and the impact of the past on the present. The novel delves into complex psychological themes while keeping readers on the edge of their seats with its suspenseful plot.
