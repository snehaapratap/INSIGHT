	<h2>Author : Joseph Campbell</h2>
	<p style="font-size:20px">"The Hero with a Thousand Faces" is a book written by Joseph Campbell and originally published in 1949. It explores the concept of the hero's journey, a recurring narrative pattern found in myths, folklore, and religious traditions across cultures. Campbell identifies common stages and archetypes that heroes go through, such as the Call to Adventure, Refusal of the Call, Meeting with the Mentor, Trials and Tests, and the Return with the Elixir. The book has had a profound impact on literature, film, and storytelling, influencing creators like George Lucas in the development of "Star Wars." It's a key work in the study of comparative mythology and the universality of human storytelling.
