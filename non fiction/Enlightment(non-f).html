	<h2>Author : Steven Pinker</h2>
	<p style="font-size:20px">"Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress" is a book written by psychologist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker. Published in 2018, the book explores the idea that human progress, driven by reason, science, and humanism, has led to significant improvements in various aspects of human life, such as health, education, quality of life, and reduction in violence. Pinker argues that despite challenges, we have made remarkable advancements over the centuries and that embracing these Enlightenment values can continue to propel us forward. The book has generated discussions about the nature of progress and the role of science and reason in modern society.
