	<h2>Author : Tara Westover</h2>
	<p style="font-size:20px">"Educated" is a memoir written by Tara Westover, published in 2018. The book recounts Westover's journey from her upbringing in a strict and isolated household in rural Idaho, where she was denied formal education, to her eventual pursuit of education against all odds. The memoir explores themes of family, self-discovery, education, and the challenges she faced as she sought to break away from her unconventional upbringing and find her own path. Tara's story is a powerful testament to the transformative power of education and the human capacity for resilience and growth.
