	<h2>Author : Sheryl Sandberg</h2>
	<p style="font-size:20px">"Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead" is a book written by Sheryl Sandberg, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Facebook (at the time of writing). Published in 2013, the book discusses various challenges that women face in the workplace and offers advice on how to overcome them. Sandberg encourages women to take a proactive approach in their careers, aiming for leadership roles and "leaning in" to opportunities. The book also delves into the concept of imposter syndrome, negotiating for better salaries, and achieving a better work-life balance. It sparked conversations about gender equality, diversity, and women's empowerment in the workplace.
