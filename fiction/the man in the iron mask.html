	<h2>Author :Alexandre Dumas</h2>
	<p style="font-size:20px">It has been eight years since Philippe was captured and locked in the prison of Bastille. He languishes here, wondering what he could have possibly done to deserve such an unending, cruel punishment. And why is his face always under the clasp of an iron mask? Eight long years, Philippe has only wondered. Now, the truth is finally revealed to him. Aramis, one of the three musketeers, goes to Philippeâ€™s cell and hands over a mirror and a portrait of the reigning King Louis XIV. Philippe is the twin brother of the King of France, and Aramis intends to put him on the throne. The corrupt and destructive ways of the current king have gone on for far too long. THE FINAL AND THE MOST DANGEROUS ADVENTURE OF THE THREE MUSKETEERS DRAWS NEAR, ONE THAT WILL BRING THEM HEAD TO HEAD WITH THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN FRANCE
